# Shamati
Kelsey's capstone project for PDX Code Guild, cohort Salmon. Presentation date: August 27, 2021.

### Name
In Hebrew, the word *shamati* (שמעתי) means *I heard*.

### Project Overview
This project will attempt to help English speakers learn Hebrew. In my early Arabic-learning days, I would use the website [Fuzzy Arabic](http://fuzzyarabic.herokuapp.com/) as a tool to help me discover words that I had heard in Arabic, but did not know the meaning to, nor if I had even heard it correctly. Shamati takes a word or combination of sounds that the user hears/heard, typed phonetically in Latin script, and offers a list of possible Hebrew words. The list will include each word's 

* meaning, 
* root letters, 
* transliteration, 
* and part of speech.

Unlike *Fuzzy Arabic* (mentioned above), I will not be adding the vowels to the output Hebrew script, as it is much more complicated than Arabic's and, unfortunately, I do not yet possess the knowledge to accurately incorporate such results. However, this should not affect the overall outcome by much, if at all, as Hebrew is largely written without vowels anyway.

### User Stories
1. As a HEBREW LEARNER, I want a tool that is simple and easy to use. No frills, no unnecessary styling and fluff - just basic input and output.

3. As a NON-ENGLISH SPEAKER, I want the option to type in my own language, because I am more comfortable producing phonemes is my own script.
